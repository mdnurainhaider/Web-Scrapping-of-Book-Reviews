        "Recently, I finished reading the life-changing book \"**Atomic Habits**\" by James Clear. As this book significantly altered my daily life, work habits, and ability to build positive routines, I became curious about others' perspectives. After searching online, I found the book on **Amazon** and noticed a mix of reviews from readers. Inspired by this, I devised a plan to **scrape these reviews, analyze the sentiments expressed by customers, and identify the factors influencing both positive and negative feedback.**"

That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that “we all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.  With the same habits, you will end up with the same results.  But with better habits, anything is possible.”\n",

James explains that “breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.”  Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks.  From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.\n",

This leads us to outcome-based habits.  The alternative is to build identity-based habits.  With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.”  The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.\n",

James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'.  He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behavior—when the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible.  Through examples, he explains that “the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.”  Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.\n",

Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded.  If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues.  James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'—a simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis.  We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit.  Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.\n",

When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through.  Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage.  An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: “after I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.”\n",

Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine.  It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action.  “Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive.  The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.”\n",

There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe.  And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.  One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.\n",

Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.”  The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.\n",

By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.  “You don't actually want the habit itself.  What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.  The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.”  That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.\n",

As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one.  To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action.  “A new habit should not feel like a challenge.  The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy.  What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.”  He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning.  Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.\n",

[1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future.  James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served.  If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen.  [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.\n",

              "                  [Chapter 15]  We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time.  “The human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.”  For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.\n",

The immediate satisfaction it delivers—as mentioned earlier in Chapter 15—is one of the many benefits that standout.  Besides that, James says, “when we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.”  The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine.  One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows:  “If you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible.  The first mistake is never the one that ruins you.  It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows.  Missing once is an accident.  Missing twice is the start of a new habit.  This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers.  Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work.  But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.”\n",

A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability:  “It is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through.  Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.”\n",

To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance.  Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that “the process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.”\n",

Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle.  Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit.

              "                  Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of those rare books that I immediately read twice in a row. It is filled with dozens of science-backed and actionable nuggets of wisdom. Do you want to improve any habits in your life? I heartily recommend Atomic Habits to you! We are all driven by our habits - many of which are unconscious. Below are 9 quotes and takeaways from this life-changing book:\n",

              "                  1. \"Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\" Atomic Habits explains why the little things you do every day matters. Your little habits matter. It may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind, but it is a big deal. Imagine if you improved your habits by only 1% every day. You'd be dramatically a different person in a year. Then imagine if you let your habits decline by 1% every day. You'd be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now. Your little habits - atomic habits - count for a lot in the long run. What little habits are you improving upon (or neglecting...) today?\n",

              "                  2. \"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\" This is such an important point in the book. Oftentimes we focus on goals in our life, while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals. As an example, I had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon.  He achieved this goal!  And then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape... He was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy. Goal achievement can actually set us back if we don't get set up sustainable systems.  Get the systems right and then we'll indeed also achieve our goals. Systems &gt; Goals.\n",

              "                  3. \"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.\" I love this quote from the book. Every action - every habit - you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become. Do you want to be a more organized person? When you develop habits and systems that organize your life, you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person. You think to yourself, \"hey, I'm an organized person.\" And then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions - a virtuous cycle! The flip side of this can be true too. What if you often show up late to meetings? You're casting votes that may make you think \"well, I'm just a person that is always late.\" An un-virtuous cycle.  Be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and, indeed, who you truly are.\n",

              "                  4. \"How long does it actually take to form a new habit? You just need to get your reps in.\" Atomic Habits answers the question of \"how much time does it take to form a new habit\" with a better answer of : X number of actions.  Meaning, you may need to simply complete a new habit 100 times for it to stick, which could be done in 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months, depending on the new habit. It is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action, versus trying to stick to a habit for just X number of days. Get your reps in.\n",

              "                  5. \"Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.\" The inverse of this is also true - increase friction between you and your bad habits! I think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy. I need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work. And I need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office! Out of sight, out of mind. In sight, and I eat it. :)  (which of course reminds me of the Dad joke I often tell my girls: \"I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it...)\n",

              "                  6. \"Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\" This is a powerful concept. I put this in practice by only \"watching TV\" when I'm on the treadmill. I am able to run at a 6 MPH pace and watch TV or videos on the iPad when I'm on a treadmill. So, I generally only watch sporting events or movies or 80s music videos on YouTube when I'm running on the treadmill. This approach actually allows me to run longer if I want to watch a full half of a game, for example. And 80s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile. :)  Think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action you're already taking. Stack them together - i.e. habit stacking.\n",

Keep track of your habit streak and 'don't break the chain.'\" Atomic Habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success. What gets measured gets managed. One of my favorite habit trackers is a FitBit/Apple Watch, which tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight and can even track food intake/calories, if you input this data.  My behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers. Atomic Habits gives you additional habit tracker resources.\n",

When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.\" We all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse. Well, that's okay for one day. Don't let it happen twice. Get back on track as soon as possible. (And, yes, sometimes we miss a habit two days in row. Just don't let it become three days...)\n",
