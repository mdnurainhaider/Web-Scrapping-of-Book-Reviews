**Project Scenario:** Recently, I finished reading the life-changing book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. As this book significantly altered my daily life, work habits, and ability to build positive routines, 
I became curious about others' perspectives. After searching online, I found the book on Amazon and noticed a mix of reviews from readers. Inspired by this, 
I devised a plan to scrape these reviews, analyze the sentiments expressed by customers, and identify the factors influencing both positive and negative feedback.

**PART ONE: Data Scraping**
**Project Goal:**
- Use Python Library, BeautifulSoup to extract book reviews from the Amazon website.
- Save the scraped data as a .csv file.
